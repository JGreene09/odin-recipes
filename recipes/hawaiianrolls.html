        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>These vegan Hawaiian Rolls are so soft and remind you of the store bought version. Perfect for sandwich rolls, dinner rolls, and more!</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups pineapple juice</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
                <li>3 1/2 – 4 cups flour (we prefer bread, can use all-purpose or whole wheat – see post for details)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp potato starch</li>
                <li>1 package instant yeast (1 package = equals 2 1/4 tsp)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2/3 cup vegan butter, divided</li>
            </ul>

        <p><h3>Step by Step</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the pineapple juice and vanilla Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a stand mixer, whisk together 3 1/2 cups flour, potato starch, yeast, brown sugar and salt. </li>
                <li>Add in the pineapple juice mixture.</li>
                <li>Let stand mixer go until dough has come together and easily coming off sides. Will be a little sticky.</li>
                <li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and sprinkle with some flour on top (enough for it to not stick to your hands). Form dough into a ball.
                </li>
                <li>Once ball is formed, grease the same bowl mixed in and place the dough ball back into the bowl. 
                    <p>*If you are oil free, then just make sure sides of bowl are floured, or use a silicone bowl to easily get it out. </p></li>
                <li>Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 60-90 minutes in a warm, draft free place until doubled.</li>
                <li>Once doubled, punch down dough and then pull off pieces into 16 even sizes. 
                    <p>*If you are oil free, then just make sure sides of bowl are floured, or use a silicone bowl to easily get it out. </p></li>
                <li>With each piece, fold sides under and roll into balls. </li>
                <li>Place each ball, seam side down, into a greased or parchment lined 9×13 baking pan.</li>
                <li>Cover pan and let rise for another 30 minutes. 
                    <p>*After this rise, you want the dough balls to be touching each other. If they are not touching, give them a little bit longer. </p></li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees while rising this second time.</li>
                <li>Using 1/3 cup of melted butter, brush each roll liberally. </li>
                <li>Put into oven and bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven.</li>
                <li>Right before serving brush with remaining 1/3 cup melted butter again. Best served warmed. </li>
            </ol>
