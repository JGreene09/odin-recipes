        <p>Isa's butternut squash alfredo is an autumn favorite, and easily subsitutes dairy products, with vegan subsitutes without diminishing flavor!</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups cubed butternut squash</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups raw cashews</li>
                <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
                <li>¼ cup mellow white miso</li>
                <li>¼ cup nutritional yeast</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta</li>
                <li>2 cups diced yellow onion</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>3 leaves fresh sage, minced</li>
                <li>¼ cup apple cider</li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>

        <p><h3>Step by Step</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Combine squash and 1 tablespoon oil on a baking sheet; toss until coated.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tender and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add cashews; simmer until softened, about 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Combine cashews and 1 1/2 cup broth in a blender; blend until very smooth. Add roasted squash, remaining 1/2 cup broth, miso, nutritional yeast, and lemon juice; blend until sauce is combined.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Transfer pasta to a serving bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and salt; cook and stir until golden brown, about 9 minutes. Add sage and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in cider; cook, stirring up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir half of the cashew sauce into the pasta. Add onion mixture. Stir in enough reserved pasta water to thin and warm sauce. Season with pepper. Garnish with parsley.</li>
            </ol>
